1--->Encapsulation : i)  A class must be independent & self-sufficient
                ii) A class must ensure all its methods are directly or indirectly
                    associated with data members (binding)

Achieved by :   By creating a class & instantiating it with objects

Effect : All functionalities & data encapsulated in the class must be 
        accessible only by instances of that class


2---->Polymorphism : the ability to do something in multiple ways!!!!

Achieved by : By using method overloading & overriding

Effect : You can use SOMETHING in multiple different ways in different situations


3---->Abstraction : Hiding irrelevant or unnecessary details

Achieved by : By creating abstract class (partial) and Interfaces (complete)

Effect : Developer can do behavior based development
